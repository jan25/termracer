# termracer
Practise your typing skills from within your terminal. This app is inspired by various online typing tutor websites.

This application is very much in development. I'll update this README according to when this app is ready to be used.

## Development
This application uses go modules. So, you could clone this repo under any
directory and build/test/run.
```
$ go build
$ ./termracer
```

The design/features are written in [NOTES.md](https://github.com/jan25/termracer/blob/master/NOTES.md).
